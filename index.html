		The important things for scientists to identify about changing viruses, like the virus that causes COVID-19, is how the change impacts people, if the vaccines still work, if treatment options are effective and if tests can still identify the active virus.

					A laboratory study on hamsters and mice in Japan published as a non-peer-reviewed preprint in mid-February 2022 suggested that BA.2, is not only more transmissible than BA.1, but may cause more severe disease.[138] Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies used to treat people infected with COVID did not have much effect on BA.2, which was "almost completely resistant" to casirivimab and imdevimab, and 35 times more resistant to sotrovimab than the original BA.1 subvariant.<br><br>

					In May 2022, a preprint indicated Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 could cause a large share of COVID-19-reinfections, beyond the increase of reinfections caused by the Omicron lineage, even for people who were infected by Omicron BA.1 due to increases in immune evasion, especially for the unvaccinated. However, the observed escape of BA.4 and BA.5 from immunity by a BA.1 infection is more moderate than of BA.1 against studied prior cases of immunity (such as immunity from specific vaccines).
